This code sets up routes for different endpoints in an API. The `app.use` function is used to define the base URL paths for various resources. The code snippet specifies three routes: `/api/v1/lists`, `/api/v1/tasks`, and `/api/v1/users`. These routes are associated with different modules or routers that handle the logic for each resource.
