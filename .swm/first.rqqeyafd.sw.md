This code snippet sets up middleware for an Express application.

*   `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')` checks if the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is set to `'development'`.

*   If the condition is true, `app.use(morgan('dev'))` sets up the `morgan` middleware with the `'dev'` format, which logs HTTP requests and response details to the console.

*   `app.use(express.json())` sets up the built-in `express.json()` middleware, which parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

*   `app.use(cors())` sets up the `cors` middleware, which allows cross-origin requests, enabling connections from a React frontend to the Express backend.
